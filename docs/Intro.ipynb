    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The industrial revolution was exactly that, a revolution. A time in which our way of living was changed drastically through the automation of the production of many goods in bulk, the advancement of science and medicine, and the following growth in the quality of life itself for so many all over the world. The rise of industry brought a great deal of incredible things with skyrocketing the world into a global society connecting nearly everyone on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though as we know today, the effects of industry are not all fantastic. In recent years more and more concerns have been raised on the topic of global warming which has been on the rise ever since the conception of modern day industry. Apart from the explosive increase of greenhouse gasses such as CO2 and methane in the atmosphere caused by human activities such as industry there are also plenty of other pollutants that the environment has to deal with. By infecting the ground and water, pollutants threaten to destroy entire ecosystems and cause many species of plants and animals to go extinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "People are starting to wake up more and more to the harsh reality of the irreversible life threatening effects of human industry. Yet, there are still plenty of people on Earth who turn a blind eye to these facts and claim that industry is something we must cherish as is. These two types of people clash often in the real world, but what are the facts? What does the data say about all this? What truly are the effects of industry on our world? By looking at data referring to  it might be possible to obtain an answer to these questions.\n"

    "### Dataset and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to conduct our research on this matter it was necessary to acquire a few datasets to look at and find connections between. Five separate datasets were selected, a dataset on water quality, a dataset on industry, a dataset on infrastructure, a dataset on innovation, and lastly a dataset on nature. Every dataset contains a column with three-letter country tags which were used to join the datasets together during the research process. Therefor this column was renamed to 'ISO3' in every dataset. The dataset were also each pivoted in order to match the same column pattern and order. With this country tag column as the join key all of the data has been ordered by year. The following is a short rundown of each dataset with links to each webpage."

    "Short description:  This dataset contains 46 different attributes and 4914 different entries. These attributes include things such as total population, rural surface water percentage and to what extend water quality and access has improved in different regions for almost every major country on earth from the year 2000 up until the year 2020. The data is split in three main categories:\n",
    "1. National (Proportion)\n",
    "2. Urban (Proportion)\n",
    "3. Rural (Proportion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing: With preprocessing the attributes' names changed, in order to make it more readable in pandas. The categories National/Urban/Rural got merged into the attribute names, so from category Rural with subcategory Surface water, the new attribute name would be changed to 'RURAL-Surface water'. In order to make up for missing data the data has been filled in, grouped by country, with the python functions ffill() and bfill(). The countries have been seperated for this step so their data wouldn't intervene. Strings like '>99' have also been changed to floats 99.0 and these are now the maximum values for these attributes."
